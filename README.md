Arkham Horror LCG module for OCTGN

### How to install the latest Version of the OCTGN module
#### Step 1
Download .nupkg file from this repository

#### Step 2
Navigate to the Local Feed of your OCTGN.
Usually this is located at C:\Users\ <Your Name>\Documents\OCTGN\LocalFeed

If you use different locations for OCTGN and its data, the 'LocalFeed' folder might be inside OCTGN\Data\LocalFeed

#### Step 3
Drop the .nupkg file you just downloaded into this folder and start OCTGN. If you already had the Arkham Horror Module installed, OCTGN should update your game now. Otherwise navigate to the Games Manager, look for "Arkham Horror - The Card Game" and click Install.
